# UmbracoInD
## Content Management tool (innovation day research)

### There are two options:
**Umbraco Cloud:** easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet, with full support for all your custom .NET code and integrations. Automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. 
**DIY:** You can download Umbraco either as a ZIP file or via NuGet( It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud) 
You need to find a place to host it yourself, and handling deployments and upgrades will be all up to you. 

###Three main steps: 

1. Create Document type  <br>

A document type consist of properties (data fields / attributes) 
Complex document types can organize properties in groups and tabs 
You can add validation to your document type (mandatory etc.) 
Set permissions for the document type (allow to create content, allow child node, allow different languages, versioning etc.) 

2. Create Content 

3. Render template
