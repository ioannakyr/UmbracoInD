Content Management tool (innovation day research)


There are two options:
Umbraco Cloud: easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet, with full support for all your custom .NET code and integrations. Automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. 
DIY: You can download Umbraco either as a ZIP file or via NuGet( It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud) 
You need to find a place to host it yourself, and handling deployments and upgrades will be all up to you.
